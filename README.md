# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Module 19 of Data Analytics Bootcamp

## Overview
Purpose of this analysis

Using the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether charity applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, we received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization.

Using Pandas and the Scikit-Learn’s StandardScaler(), I preprocessed the dataset in order to compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model. Using TensorFlow, I designed a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. Then, I compiled, trained, and evaluated my binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy. Finally, using TensorFlow again, I attempted to optimize my model in order to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%. I was not able to achieve an accuracy higher than 75% in three attempts to do so.


## Results

Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
    
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
